// This file contains the Base64 encoded data for the 'Hind-Regular' TrueType Font.
// Hind is an open-source font family supporting the Devanagari and Latin scripts.
// It includes the Indian Rupee Symbol (₹) and is suitable for embedding in PDFs.
// The font has been converted to a Base64 string that jsPDF can load into its Virtual File System.
// This is a truncated version for demonstration purposes. A full version would be much longer.
